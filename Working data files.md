# Working data files

The `pp-mysql-mdbdecode` database contains the entire contents of Anthony Di Fiore's "Proyecto Primates Main Database" for the years 2012 and 2013 dumped from MDBDecode in MySQL format.

The `pp-mysql-bullzip` database contains the same, but was dumped from Bullzip.

Both of these were loaded into MySQL databases running on a local server in MAMP through the Valentina Studio interface.


The `pp-pg-mdbdecode` database contains the entire contents of Anthony Di Fiore's "Proyecto Primates Main Database" for the years 2012 and 2013 dumped from MDBDecode in PostgreSQL format.


The `pp-pg-bullzip` database contains the entire contents of Anthony Di Fiore's "Proyecto Primates Main Database" for the years 2012 and 2013 dumped from Bullzip in PostgreSQL format.

**Note: MDBDecode does not allow you to specify the name of a database to DROP then CREATE the way that Bullzip does**

The `locations` database contains the entire set of GPS tracks for the Proyecto Primtes project for the same time period
